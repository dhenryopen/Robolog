Robolog
=======
Robolog is a FIRST robotics tool created by Juxtapose Technologies and FRC Team 4918.
Robolog takes data from the RoboRIO as well as any custom outputs you'd like and formats it into RFC 4627 JSON. That JSON can then be uploaded to a cloud service (Microsoft Azure is our platform of choice) and parsed using our custom backend (still a work in progress)
